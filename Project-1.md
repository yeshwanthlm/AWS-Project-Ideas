** Document Management System with Version Control **
Project Description: In the digital age, the ability to manage documents effectively is critical for businesses of all sizes. Organizations struggle with maintaining a single source of truth for their documents as they are often scattered across different systems, leading to inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and a lack of collaborative capabilities. The goal is to develop a centralized, secure, and user-friendly document management system that provides version control, access logs, and collaboration tools for enterprise use. The system must ensure data integrity, support regulatory compliance, and enhance productivity through seamless document handling.

*** Recommended AWS Services: ***
● Amazon EC2: To run the application and web server.
● Amazon S3: For durable document storage with built-in versioning.
● Amazon EBS: To provide persistent block storage for EC2 instances.
● Amazon RDS: For relational database services to manage metadata.
● AWS IAM: To control user access and permissions.
● AWS KMS: To manage keys used for encrypting documents.
● Amazon CloudWatch: For monitoring the system and setting alarms.

*** Objectives: ***
● Develop a web-based interface for easy document upload, retrieval, and management.
● Implement version control to track changes and allow rollback to previous versions.
● Secure documents using encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information.
● Provide collaboration features such as document check-in/check-out, commenting, and
change tracking. Additional Points:
● The system may include a full-text search feature for quick document discovery.
● It must support batch processing for mass uploads and downloads.
● Implement detailed logging to track user actions and changes to documents.
